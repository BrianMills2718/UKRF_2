# Honest Next Steps - Starting From Reality

## 🔍 Current Reality Check (June 17, 2025)

### ✅ What Actually Works:
```bash
# Verified with these commands:
docker-compose ps  # Neo4j + Redis running
python -c "from src.tools import get_all_tools; from src.utils.database import DatabaseManager; print(list(get_all_tools(DatabaseManager()).keys()))"
# Output: ['T107', 'T110', 'T111', 'T121']
```

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:
```bash
claude mcp list  # Output: No MCP servers configured
python test_vertical_slice.py  # ImportError: cannot import name 'EmbeddingGenerator'
python -c "from src.tools.phase1 import PDFLoader"  # ImportError
```

### 📊 Honest Metrics:
- **Tools Implemented**: 4/121 (3.3%)
- **MCP Servers Configured**: 0/1 (0%)
- **Working Workflows**: 0/1 (0%)
- **Database Health**: 3/3 (100%) ✅

## 🎯 Next Steps - Week by Week

### Week 1: Prove One Tool Works End-to-End

#### Day 1-2: Configure MCP Server
```bash
# Goal: Get MCP server actually connected to Claude Code
# Verification: claude mcp list shows super-digimon

# Steps:
1. Create main.py to run MCP server
2. Test MCP server starts without errors
3. Configure in Claude Code: claude mcp add super-digimon "python main.py"
4. Verify: claude mcp list shows super-digimon
```

#### Day 3-4: Implement T01 (PDF Loader)
```bash
# Goal: Load a PDF and store document in SQLite
# Verification: PDF → SQLite entry with confidence score

# Steps:
1. Implement src/tools/phase1/t01_pdf_loader.py
2. Test: python -c "from src.tools.phase1.t01_pdf_loader import PDFLoader; print('Import works')"
3. Test: PDF file → Document object with metadata
4. Test: Document stored in SQLite with proper schema
```

#### Day 5-7: One Complete Mini-Workflow
```bash
# Goal: PDF → SQLite → Simple query back
# Verification: test_mini_workflow.py passes

# Steps:
1. PDF loaded via T01
2. Document stored in SQLite via database manager
3. Document queried back via reference ID
4. All provenance tracked via T110
5. Quality scores assigned via T111
```

### Week 2: Add Text Processing

#### Implement T15a (Text Chunker)
```bash
# Goal: Document → Text chunks in SQLite
# Verification: Document splits into chunks with overlap and positions

# Steps:
1. Implement src/tools/phase2/t15a_text_chunker.py
2. Test: Document → List of chunks with positions
3. Test: Chunks stored in SQLite with document references
4. Test: Chunks can be queried back by document ID
```

#### Implement T23a (Entity Extractor)
```bash
# Goal: Text chunks → Named entities (spaCy)
# Verification: Chunks → Entities with mentions and confidence

# Steps:
1. Implement src/tools/phase2/t23a_entity_extractor.py
2. Test: Text → spaCy entities with positions
3. Test: Create mentions in three-level identity system
4. Test: Entities stored in SQLite with mention references
```

### Week 3: Graph Construction

#### Implement T31 (Entity Node Builder)
```bash
# Goal: Mentions → Neo4j entity nodes
# Verification: SQLite mentions become Neo4j nodes

# Steps:
1. Implement src/tools/phase3/t31_entity_node_builder.py
2. Test: Mentions → Entity nodes in Neo4j
3. Test: Cross-database references work (sqlite://mention/X → neo4j://entity/Y)
4. Test: Identity service handles canonical names
```

#### First Real Workflow Test
```bash
# Goal: PDF → Neo4j entities end-to-end
# Verification: Complete data flow with quality tracking

# Steps:
1. test_first_workflow.py: PDF → chunks → entities → Neo4j
2. Verify provenance chain complete (T110)
3. Verify quality scores propagated (T111)
4. Verify workflow state can be checkpointed (T121)
```

### Week 4: Query Capability

#### Implement Basic Query
```bash
# Goal: Query Neo4j entities by name
# Verification: Find entities, return with confidence

# Steps:
1. Simple entity search tool
2. Test: Query "Apple" → Find Apple Inc. entity
3. Test: Return confidence scores and provenance
4. Test: Query works via MCP from Claude Code
```

## 🔧 Verification Requirements

### Before Claiming ANY Progress:

#### Tool Implementation:
```bash
# Must pass ALL these tests:
python -c "from src.tools.phaseX.tXX_tool import Tool; print('✓ Import works')"
python test_tXX_unit.py  # Unit test passes
python test_tXX_integration.py  # Integration test passes
echo "Tool TX verified at $(date)"
```

#### Database Integration:
```bash
# Must pass ALL these tests:
python -c "from src.utils.database import DatabaseManager; assert all(DatabaseManager().health_check().values())"
python test_database_integration.py  # Cross-database references work
echo "Database integration verified at $(date)"
```

#### MCP Configuration:
```bash
# Must show:
claude mcp list | grep super-digimon || echo "❌ MCP not configured"
python -c "import mcp; print('MCP client can connect')"  # If we add client test
echo "MCP verified at $(date)"
```

## 📈 Success Metrics (Honest)

### Week 1 Success:
- [ ] MCP server appears in `claude mcp list`
- [ ] T01 loads a PDF → SQLite document entry
- [ ] test_mini_workflow.py passes
- [ ] All 4 core services (T107, T110, T111, T121) used in workflow

### Week 2 Success:
- [ ] T15a chunks text → SQLite chunk entries
- [ ] T23a extracts entities → SQLite mention entries  
- [ ] Cross-table references work (documents → chunks → mentions)
- [ ] Quality scores propagate through pipeline

### Week 3 Success:
- [ ] T31 creates Neo4j nodes from SQLite mentions
- [ ] Cross-database references work (sqlite:// → neo4j://)
- [ ] Complete PDF → Neo4j workflow functional
- [ ] All provenance tracked end-to-end

### Week 4 Success:
- [ ] Simple entity queries work from Claude Code via MCP
- [ ] Results include confidence scores and source documents
- [ ] System demonstrates basic GraphRAG capability
- [ ] Foundation ready for horizontal expansion

## 🚨 Failure Criteria

### Stop and Reassess If:
- Any verification command fails
- Tests start passing but then break
- Database health checks fail
- MCP server stops responding
- Memory/performance issues emerge

### Weekly Reality Checks:
```bash
# Run every Friday:
bash weekly_reality_check.sh > status_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
git add status_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
git commit -m "Weekly reality check - $(date)"
```

## 🎯 Honest Timeline

- **Week 1**: Prove infrastructure works (1 tool + MCP)
- **Week 2**: Prove text processing works (2 more tools)
- **Week 3**: Prove graph construction works (1 more tool)
- **Week 4**: Prove query capability works (basic GraphRAG)
- **Month 2**: Horizontal expansion with proven patterns
- **Month 3**: Complete tool implementation
- **Month 4**: Polish and optimization

**Total implementation time: 4 months for 121 tools**
**Confidence level: Medium (based on infrastructure working)**

This timeline assumes we maintain the verification protocol and don't make false claims about progress.
