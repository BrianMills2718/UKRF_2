# Documentation Consolidation - 2025-06-18

## What Was Consolidated

### Original Documentation (6+ files)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` → Archived (superseded by ROADMAP_v2.md)
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` → Archived (integrated into ARCHITECTURE.md)
- `CLAUDE.md` → Updated with v2.0 strategic focus
- `README.md` → Kept as main project entry point
- `UI_README.md` → Kept for UI-specific instructions

### New Core Documentation (3 files)
1. **`STATUS.md`** - Current state: what works, what's broken, lessons learned
2. **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Integration design and component contracts  
3. **`ROADMAP_v2.md`** - Strategic plan based on integration lessons

## Rationale for Changes

### Problems with Original Docs
- **Documentation sprawl**: 6+ overlapping documents
- **Outdated information**: Roadmap didn't match actual capabilities
- **Missing integration focus**: No documentation of phase interaction requirements
- **Inconsistent status**: Documentation claimed things worked that didn't

### Benefits of Consolidation
- **Single source of truth** for current system status
- **Clear architectural guidance** for integration decisions
- **Strategic roadmap** based on actual lessons learned
- **Reduced maintenance burden** for keeping docs current

## Archive Contents

### `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` (Original v1.0)
**Status**: Archived - Superseded by ROADMAP_v2.md  
**Why**: Original roadmap assumed phases could be built independently without integration architecture

**Key lessons extracted**:
- Phase-by-phase development approach (kept)
- Tool modularization concept (kept)
- Academic compliance requirements (kept)
- **Missing**: Integration testing strategy (added to v2.0)

### `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
**Status**: Archived - Content integrated into ARCHITECTURE.md  
**Why**: Structure documentation should be part of architecture documentation

**Key content preserved**:
- Component layer descriptions
- File organization patterns  
- Service responsibility boundaries
- **Enhanced with**: Integration patterns and interface contracts

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
- **Old**: Check IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md for next steps
- **New**: Check ROADMAP_v2.md for architecture-first development plan

- **Old**: Check PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md for component organization
- **New**: Check ARCHITECTURE.md for integration patterns and interfaces

### For Users
- **Old**: Multiple docs to understand system status
- **New**: Single STATUS.md shows what actually works vs what's broken

### For Contributors
- **Old**: Build phases independently, integrate later
- **New**: Design interfaces first, build with integration testing

## What's Next

The new documentation structure supports the v2.0 strategic focus:

1. **STATUS.md** provides honest assessment of current capabilities
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** guides integration-first development
3. **ROADMAP_v2.md** prioritizes architectural foundation over feature accumulation

This consolidation was necessary after the Phase 1→2 integration failure revealed that **documentation complexity was masking architectural problems**.
