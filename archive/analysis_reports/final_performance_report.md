# Final Performance Report

## Test Results

- **Original workflow**: 60.50s
- **Optimized (with PageRank)**: 54.00s (1.1x speedup)
- **Optimized (no PageRank)**: 7.55s (8.0x speedup)

## Optimizations Applied

1. **F1: Service Singleton Pattern** ✅
   - Shared services eliminate redundant creation
2. **F2: Connection Pool Management** ✅
   - Single Neo4j driver with connection pooling
3. **F3: Performance Validation** ✅
   - Automated testing and profiling

## Recommendations

- PageRank accounts for ~88% of processing time
- Consider query-specific subgraph PageRank
- Or defer PageRank to query time only when needed
