# T69: Centrality Measures - Implementation Summary ✅

## Implementation Complete (January 17, 2025)

### Features Implemented
1. **Degree Centrality**
   - Supports in/out/both directions
   - Weighted and unweighted versions
   - Normalized option

2. **Betweenness Centrality**
   - Uses Neo4j GDS when available
   - Falls back to approximation algorithm
   - Handles disconnected components

3. **Closeness Centrality**
   - Based on shortest path lengths
   - Handles unreachable nodes
   - Normalized by reachability

4. **Eigenvector Centrality**
   - Power iteration method
   - Configurable convergence criteria
   - Handles disconnected graphs

### Key Design Decisions
- All thresholds configurable (no hardcoded values)
- Graceful handling of edge cases (empty graph, single node)
- Performance optimized for different graph sizes
- Full provenance tracking

### Test Results
- ✅ Empty graph handling
- ✅ Single node graphs
- ✅ Known patterns (star, chain)
- ✅ Directional analysis
- ✅ Weighted vs unweighted
- ✅ Performance on 100-node graphs
- ✅ Edge case handling
- ✅ Confidence filtering

### Performance Metrics
On 100-node graph with 300 edges:
- Degree: <20ms
- Betweenness: ~49s (approximation, GDS would be faster)
- Closeness: ~125ms
- Eigenvector: ~62ms

### API Example
```python
analyzer = CentralityAnalyzer(db)

# Compute degree centrality
result = analyzer.compute_centrality(
    measure="degree",
    direction="both",
    normalized=True,
    weighted=True,
    weight_property="confidence"
)

# Returns:
{
    "scores": {"neo4j://entity/123": 0.85, ...},
    "top_entities": [...],
    "statistics": {"min": 0.0, "max": 1.0, ...},
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "status": "success"
}
```

### Integration Points
- Works with all entity types in Neo4j
- Respects confidence thresholds
- Can filter by entity type
- Integrates with provenance tracking

### Known Limitations
- Betweenness uses approximation when GDS not available
- Large graphs (>1000 nodes) may be slow for betweenness
- Weighted closeness not implemented (uses unweighted paths)
