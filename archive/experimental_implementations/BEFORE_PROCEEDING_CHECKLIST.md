# Before Proceeding Checklist

Based on our adversarial testing, here's what we must do before implementing more tools:

## 🔴 Critical Fixes (Must Do)

### 1. Fix Remaining Phase 1 Issues
- [ ] **T41 Embedding Generator**: Add fallback for entities without text
  - Use entity name if no text content
  - Skip entities gracefully if no textual data
  
- [ ] **T94 Natural Language Query**: Fix 25% success rate
  - Make all thresholds configurable (found 6 hardcoded values)
  - Improve query parsing logic
  - Add fallback strategies

- [ ] **PageRank Score Storage**: Fix attempt to save as Entity field
  - Store in separate property or attributes

### 2. Fix Hardcoded Values (31 found!)
- [ ] **Quality Service**: 7 hardcoded thresholds
- [ ] **Provenance Service**: 2 hardcoded depth limits  
- [ ] **All confidence scores**: Should be configurable

## 🟡 Important Setup (Should Do)

### 3. Create Test Infrastructure
- [ ] **Test Entity Builder** to prevent timestamp issues
- [ ] **Edge case test suite** for all tools
- [ ] **Integration test chains** (PDF → PageRank)
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** with thresholds

### 4. Documentation Cleanup
- [ ] **SPEC_DEVIATIONS.md**: Document where implementation differs from spec
- [ ] **TOOL_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md**: Show which tools are production-ready
- [ ] Update tool count in CLAUDE.md (currently says 7, actually 13)

### 5. Automation Setup  
- [ ] Add `detect_hardcoded.py` to pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline with:
  - Hardcoded value detection
  - Mock detection
  - Edge case tests
  - Performance benchmarks

## 🟢 Good Practices Established

### What We've Already Done:
✅ Created tool template with configurability  
✅ Documented design principles  
✅ Created implementation checklist  
✅ Fixed timestamp handling  
✅ Fixed community detection hardcoding  
✅ No mocks in production code  

## 📊 Current State Assessment

### Tools Implemented: 13 of 121
| Category | Count | Quality |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Fully Working | 5 | T13, T49, T50, T52, T56 |
| Mostly Working | 5 | T01, T23b, T24, T31, T68 |
| Needs Major Fix | 3 | T41, T94, T23a |

### Confidence Level: 65%
- Core infrastructure: ✅ Real and working
- Graph operations: ✅ Proven functional  
- Tool quality: ⚠️ Varies significantly
- Edge cases: ❌ Not well tested

## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan

### Week 1: Fix What We Have
1. Monday: Fix T41, T94, PageRank storage
2. Tuesday: Fix all hardcoded values
3. Wednesday: Create test infrastructure
4. Thursday: Run full adversarial test suite
5. Friday: Document all deviations and updates

### Week 2: Harden Process
1. Set up automation (pre-commit, CI/CD)
2. Create performance benchmarks
3. Add edge case tests to all tools
4. Create integration test suite

### Week 3+: Resume Implementation
1. Use new template and checklist
2. Follow standards strictly
3. Test thoroughly before claiming completion

## ⚠️ Do NOT Proceed Until:

1. **T94 success rate > 60%** (currently 25%)
2. **Hardcoded values removed** (31 violations)
3. **Test infrastructure created**
4. **Automation in place**

## 🚀 Signs We're Ready to Continue:

- [ ] All existing tools pass edge case tests
- [ ] Hardcoded detector finds 0 violations
- [ ] Integration tests work end-to-end
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Documentation fully updated

Only when these boxes are checked should we implement tools 14-121.
