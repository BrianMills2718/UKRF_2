# Super-Digimon Progress Summary

## Milestones Completed

### ✅ Milestone 1: Core Infrastructure (January 16, 2025)
- Database integration (Neo4j + SQLite + FAISS)
- Basic tools: PDF loader, chunker, entity extractor
- Identity and quality services

### ✅ Milestone 2: Relationship Extraction (January 17, 2025)
**Problem**: Initial NLP extraction had 85% CO_OCCURS_WITH relationships
**Solution**: Implemented T23b LLM-based extractor
**Results**:
- CO_OCCURS_WITH: 0% (requirement <70%)
- Complex queries: 66.7% success (requirement >60%)
- Relationship accuracy: 80% (requirement >60%)

### ✅ Milestone 3: Community & Multi-hop (January 17, 2025)
**Implementations**:
- T31: Community detection (Louvain algorithm)
- T49: Multi-hop query
- T50: Neighborhood search
- T52: Path finding
- T56: Community summary

**Results**:
- 3 communities detected with 0.75 modularity
- 3+ hop paths working
- Sub-second query performance

## Key Learnings

1. **LLM > NLP for Relationships**: GPT-3.5 extracts semantic relationships without CO_OCCURS_WITH pollution
2. **Community Detection Works**: Simple Louvain implementation successfully identifies clusters
3. **Neo4j Performance**: Multi-hop queries execute in milliseconds
4. **Adversarial Testing**: Essential for catching premature success claims

## Next Steps

### Milestone 4: Statistical Analysis
- Implement T69-T71 (centrality, clustering, statistics)
- Validate against NetworkX benchmarks
- Integrate with query system

### Milestone 5: Full Pipeline
- Fix timeout issues with batch processing
- Implement remaining core tools
- End-to-end PDF → Answer validation

## Performance Metrics

- Entity extraction: 1.48s per chunk (LLM)
- 3-hop query: 0.006s average
- Community detection: 0.21s for 100 entities
- PageRank: <1s for typical graphs
