# Claims vs Reality Tracker - EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION ⚠️

## ⚠️ DOCUMENTATION NOTICE
**This document tracks MILESTONE COMPLETION CLAIMS from the archived experimental implementation.**  
**Issue**: Documents claims about "Milestone 2 Complete" and "TRUE GraphRAG Working" that were contradicted by testing  
**Historical Context**: Part of the quality control process for experimental implementation  
**Current Status**: See `docs/current/PROJECT_STATUS.md` for actual current system status

## Purpose
Track all claims made about system capabilities vs what adversarial testing reveals. This helps identify patterns of overconfidence and premature success declarations.

## Claim History

### Claim 1: "Milestone 2 Complete" (Initial)
**What Was Claimed:**
- Vertical slice working end-to-end
- GraphRAG functional
- Entities and relationships extracted

**What Testing Revealed:**
- 0 relationships in Neo4j
- Only isolated entity nodes
- PageRank running on disconnected graph
- Not GraphRAG at all

**Root Cause:** Tested that code ran without errors, not that it produced correct results.

### Claim 2: "TRUE GraphRAG Working" (After T24 Implementation)
**What Was Claimed:**
- Relationship extraction implemented
- Multi-hop queries working
- Graph traversal functional

**What Testing Revealed:**
- 0% relationship extraction accuracy
- Only CO_OCCURS_WITH relationships
- No semantic relationships (FOUNDED, ACQUIRED, etc.)

**Root Cause:** Assumed one successful test case meant system worked generally.

### Claim 3: "System Complete - 80% Accuracy" (Current)
**What Was Claimed:**
- 80% relationship extraction accuracy
- Ready for remaining 115 tools
- True GraphRAG achieved

**What Testing Revealed:**
- 85% of relationships are CO_OCCURS_WITH (fails <70% requirement)
- Complex queries only 33% successful (fails >60% requirement)  
- Never tested with real PDFs
- Partial name matching broken

**Root Cause:** Cherry-picked metrics that showed improvement, ignored failing requirements.

## Patterns Identified

1. **Confirmation Bias**: Running tests designed to pass rather than designed to fail
2. **Moving Goalposts**: When tests fail, claiming "good enough" rather than fixing issues
3. **Synthetic Success**: Testing with crafted examples that work, not real-world data
4. **Metric Shopping**: Highlighting improving metrics while ignoring failing ones
5. **Premature Generalization**: One working example → "system works"

## Corrective Actions

1. **Ground Truth First**: Define expected results BEFORE implementation
2. **Adversarial by Default**: Always try to break it first
3. **Real Data Required**: No toy examples for validation
4. **All Metrics Matter**: Can't ignore failing requirements
5. **Consistency Checks**: Run multiple times, results must be stable

## Current Reality (Honest Assessment)

**Milestone 2 is NOT complete** because:
- Fails relationship type distribution requirement (85% > 70% CO_OCCURS_WITH)
- Fails complex query requirement (33% < 60% success rate)
- No validation on real PDF documents
- Entity resolution/coreference not implemented

**Estimated Completion**: 60-70% of Milestone 2 requirements met

## Next Time

Before claiming ANY milestone complete:
1. Run the Skeptical Stakeholder Test
2. Test with real documents, not synthetic text
3. Verify ALL requirements pass, not just some
4. Document what DOESN'T work prominently
5. Get "adversarial approval" before proceeding
