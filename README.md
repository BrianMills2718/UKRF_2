# Super-Digimon GraphRAG-First Universal Analytics

A GraphRAG system designed for extensibility into broader analytical workflows. Processes documents (PDFs, text) into structured graph databases with plans for universal analytical platform capabilities. Currently implements core GraphRAG pipeline with Neo4j storage.

**üö® HONEST STATUS**: Early development system with **Phase 1 working, Phase 2 broken, documentation previously inflated**.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Start Neo4j database
docker-compose up -d neo4j

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Verify setup
python -m scripts.test_connection
```

## What Actually Works (Verified)

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Basic GraphRAG Pipeline
```
PDF Document ‚Üí Text Extraction ‚Üí spaCy NER ‚Üí Neo4j Graph ‚Üí PageRank
```

**Verified Capabilities**:
- **PDF Processing**: Extract text from PDFs (tested with 293KB files)
- **Entity Extraction**: spaCy NER finds PERSON, ORG, GPE, DATE entities (tested: 484 entities from wiki1.pdf)
- **Relationship Extraction**: Pattern-based extraction (tested: 228 relationships)
- **Graph Storage**: Neo4j database with entity/relationship storage
- **PageRank Calculation**: Network analysis (fails but doesn't break extraction)
- **Web UI**: Document upload, processing, visualization at http://localhost:8501

**Performance**: 7.55s processing time (without PageRank) for 293KB PDF - verified metrics from performance optimization

### ‚ùå Phase 2: Enhanced Pipeline (BROKEN)
**Status**: Integration failure due to API compatibility issues  
**Error**: `WorkflowStateService.update_workflow_progress() got an unexpected keyword argument 'current_step'`  
**Root Cause**: Phase 2 developed against different service API version

### üîß Phase 3: Standalone Tools (NOT INTEGRATED)
**T301 Multi-Document Fusion Tools**: Work independently but not integrated into main pipeline

## Architecture (Current Reality)

```
Web UI (Streamlit) ‚Üí Phase 1 Workflow ‚Üí Neo4j Database
                      ‚Üì
               spaCy NER + Pattern Matching
                      ‚Üì
              484 entities, 228 relationships
```

**Actual Tool Count**: ~23 Python files (vs previously claimed 121)  
**Working Phases**: 1 out of 3  
**Database Integration**: Neo4j working, SQLite working, Qdrant available

## Test the Current System

### Verify What Works
```bash
# Test Phase 1 processing
python test_phase1_direct.py

# Test UI functionality  
python test_ui_real.py

# Launch UI for document testing
python start_graphrag_ui.py
# Then visit http://localhost:8501
```

### Verify What's Broken
```bash
# Try Phase 2 (will show API compatibility error)
# Select "Phase 2: Enhanced" in UI and upload document
# Expected error: "WorkflowStateService.update_workflow_progress() got an unexpected keyword argument 'current_step'"
```

- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) - Integration failure analysis + new documentation standards
- [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Integration lessons and design patterns

## Lessons Learned

**Documentation Dysfunction**: We repeatedly created "honest" documentation that became dishonest by claiming aspirational features as implemented.

**Integration Failure**: Phase 1‚Üí2 switching broke due to API incompatibility that wasn't caught by testing.

**Path Forward**: Fix integration architecture and documentation verification before adding new features.
