# T71: Graph Statistics - Implementation Summary ✅

## Implementation Complete (January 17, 2025)

### Features Implemented
1. **Basic Metrics**
   - Node and edge counts
   - Graph density
   - Average degree
   - Self-loop detection
   - Directed graph support

2. **Degree Distribution**
   - In/out/total degree statistics
   - Min, max, mean, std, median
   - Degree histogram (top 10)

3. **Component Analysis**
   - Connected component detection
   - Component size distribution
   - Singleton node counting
   - Fallback algorithm when APOC unavailable

4. **Path Metrics**
   - Graph diameter and radius
   - Average path length
   - Connectivity checking
   - Sampling support for large graphs

5. **Type Distribution**
   - Entity type counts
   - Relationship type counts
   - Top 20 types shown

6. **Assortativity**
   - Degree correlation coefficient
   - Handles directed graphs
   - Pearson correlation based

### Key Design Decisions
- All parameters configurable (no hardcoded values)
- Efficient algorithms with sampling for expensive operations
- Handles all graph types (empty, single node, disconnected)
- Full provenance tracking

### Test Results
- ✅ Empty graph handling
- ✅ Single node graphs
- ✅ Complete graphs (K5)
- ✅ Star patterns
- ✅ Disconnected components
- ✅ Type filtering
- ✅ Assortativity calculation
- ✅ Performance (100 nodes: basic <20ms, full ~7s)
- ✅ Edge cases (self-loops, filters)

### Performance Metrics
On 100-node graph with 300 edges:
- Basic metrics only: ~13ms
- With degree distribution: ~18ms
- With components: ~105ms
- Full statistics: ~7s (due to path metrics)

### API Example
```python
analyzer = GraphStatisticsAnalyzer(db)

# Compute comprehensive statistics
result = analyzer.compute_statistics(
    entity_type="PERSON",
    relationship_type="KNOWS",
    include_degree_distribution=True,
    include_component_analysis=True,
    include_path_metrics=True,
    sample_size=50,  # For large graphs
    min_confidence=0.5
)

# Returns:
{
    "basic_metrics": {
        "node_count": 100,
        "edge_count": 300,
        "density": 0.03,
        "average_degree": 6.0,
        "self_loops": 0
    },
    "degree_distribution": {
        "in_degree_mean": 3.0,
        "out_degree_mean": 3.0,
        "degree_histogram": [...]
    },
    "component_stats": {
        "num_components": 1,
        "largest_component_size": 100
    },
    "path_metrics": {
        "diameter": 5,
        "average_path_length": 2.8
    },
    "assortativity": 0.23,
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "status": "success"
}
```

### Integration Points
- Works with all entity and relationship types
- Supports confidence filtering
- Can analyze subgraphs by type
- Integrates with provenance tracking

### Known Limitations
- Path metrics expensive for large graphs (uses sampling)
- Component detection falls back to BFS when APOC unavailable
- Assortativity only considers degree (not other attributes)
