# Immediate Action Plan - Starting Now

## ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy Change

**OLD**: Build large features â†’ test later â†’ discover major issues
**NEW**: Build tiny pieces â†’ test immediately â†’ fix before moving on

**Rule**: No implementation step longer than 4 hours
**Rule**: Every step must have adversarial tests that try to break it
**Rule**: No progress claims without verification commands

## âš¡ Starting Right Now - Next 8 Hours

### Hours 1-4: Step 1A - Basic MCP Server
**Goal**: MCP server starts and responds to basic requests

**Micro-Tasks**:
1. Create `main.py` with minimal MCP server (1 hour)
2. Test server starts without errors (30 min)
3. Write adversarial tests for malformed input (1 hour)
4. Test server handles interruptions gracefully (30 min)
5. Document verification commands (1 hour)

**Verification Command**:
```bash
timeout 5s python main.py && echo "âœ“ Server starts" || echo "âœ— Server fails"
```

**Adversarial Tests Must Include**:
- Malformed JSON input
- Server interruption (SIGINT, SIGKILL)
- Multiple concurrent connections
- Invalid MCP protocol messages

### Hours 5-8: Step 1B - Claude Code Integration
**Goal**: `claude mcp list` shows super-digimon server

**Micro-Tasks**:
1. Configure MCP server in Claude Code (1 hour)
2. Test basic communication (1 hour)
3. Write adversarial tests for invalid configurations (1 hour)
4. Test server restart scenarios (1 hour)

**Verification Command**:
```bash
claude mcp list | grep super-digimon && echo "âœ“ MCP configured" || echo "âœ— MCP not configured"
```

**Adversarial Tests Must Include**:
- Invalid server paths
- Server with missing dependencies
- Concurrent Claude Code sessions
- Server crashes during communication

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Cycle Template (Every 4 Hours)

### 1. Unit Test (30 minutes)
- Basic functionality works
- Expected inputs produce expected outputs
- Error conditions handled gracefully

### 2. Adversarial Test (60 minutes)
- Try to break it with edge cases
- Invalid inputs, malformed data
- Resource exhaustion, timing attacks
- Concurrency issues

### 3. Integration Test (30 minutes)
- Works with existing components
- Cross-system communication works
- Data flows through entire chain

### 4. Document & Commit (30 minutes)
- Record exact verification commands
- Commit working state
- Update status documentation

## ðŸš¨ Failure Protocol

### If Any Test Fails:
1. **STOP** implementing new features
2. **FIX** the failing test immediately
3. **RE-RUN** all tests for that step
4. **DOCUMENT** what was fixed and why
5. Only then proceed to next step

### If Multiple Tests Fail:
1. **ROLLBACK** to last known good commit
2. **RE-ANALYZE** the approach
3. **BREAK DOWN** the step into smaller pieces
4. **START OVER** with micro-steps

## ðŸ”§ Required Test Categories

### Every Implementation Step Must Have:

#### 1. Happy Path Test
```python
def test_happy_path():
    # Test with valid, expected input
    result = function(valid_input)
    assert result == expected_output
    print("âœ“ Happy path works")
```

#### 2. Edge Case Tests
```python
def test_edge_cases():
    # Empty input
    # Maximum size input
    # Minimum size input
    # Boundary conditions
```

#### 3. Error Condition Tests
```python
def test_error_conditions():
    # Invalid input types
    # Missing required parameters
    # Malformed data
    # System resource unavailable
```

#### 4. Security Tests
```python
def test_security():
    # Injection attempts (SQL, Cypher, path traversal)
    # Buffer overflow attempts
    # Authentication bypass attempts
    # Access control violations
```

#### 5. Concurrency Tests
```python
def test_concurrency():
    # Multiple simultaneous requests
    # Race conditions
    # Deadlock scenarios
    # Resource contention
```

#### 6. Resource Tests
```python
def test_resources():
    # Memory usage under load
    # File handle limits
    # Network connection limits
    # Database connection pool exhaustion
```

## ðŸ“Š Success Criteria for Each Step

### Step 1A Success:
- [ ] `timeout 5s python main.py` exits with code 0
- [ ] Server responds to basic MCP protocol messages
- [ ] Adversarial tests pass (malformed input, interruptions)
- [ ] Integration test shows MCP communication works

### Step 1B Success:
- [ ] `claude mcp list | grep super-digimon` finds the server
- [ ] Claude Code can communicate with server
- [ ] Adversarial tests pass (invalid configs, restarts)
- [ ] Integration test shows end-to-end communication

### Step 1C Success:
- [ ] Server exposes echo_test tool
- [ ] Tool works via MCP protocol from Claude Code
- [ ] Adversarial tests pass (invalid inputs, edge cases)
- [ ] Integration test shows tool execution works

## ðŸŽ¯ Daily Verification

### End of Each Day:
```bash
# Run complete verification
echo "Daily Status: $(date)" > daily_status_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
echo "Completed Steps:" >> daily_status_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt

# List completed steps with verification
for step in step*_verification.txt; do
    if [ -f "$step" ]; then
        echo "âœ“ $(basename $step .txt)" >> daily_status_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
    fi
done

# List failed/incomplete steps
echo "Failed/Incomplete Steps:" >> daily_status_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
# Check for any .py files without corresponding verification

# Commit daily status
git add daily_status_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
git commit -m "Daily status: $(date +%Y%m%d)"
```

## ðŸš€ Start Command

```bash
# Begin Step 1A right now:
echo "Starting Step 1A at $(date)" > step1A_log.txt
# Create main.py
# Test basic server
# Run adversarial tests
# Document results
echo "Completed Step 1A at $(date)" >> step1A_log.txt
```

**The key**: Every 4 hours, we have a working, tested, documented piece that's ready for the next step. No more building on unverified assumptions.
